## Entry 1                     Date: 12/6/19

Today I did more research about my topic, Virtual Reality.

I learned that virtual reality comes with many benefits overall.
  It can be used for gaining skills, for entertainment and educational purposes.
    Iâ€™ve also learned that in the mid 1990s till this day, therapists are still using virtual reality to help individuals who have a difficult time interacting with people. (What are you learning in class that applies directly to your project? How will you use the synthesis practice we did today on your project?)

I used reliable sources with links that had .org, .com and more.

A skill that I used was organization skills which helped me stay neat and prevent me from making further mistakes.
